A modified subset of Stack Overflow data consisting of two data sets based on the demographics and data technologies were analyzed to identify the present and future data technologies trends among people of various different age groups all across the world.

A modified subset of Stack Overflow data consisting of two data sets based on the demographics and data technologies were used to visualize the present and future data trends based on their demographics.

As these data sets were subsets of data sets and therefore they did not require a lot of cleaning . Hence no particular methodology was used to visualize the data. We only used filtering option to ignore the nulls values from data.

A modified subset of Stack Overflow data consisting of two data sets based on the demographics and data technologies were analyzed to identify the present and future data technologies trends among people of various different age groups all across the world.

Dashboard was created having three different tabs i.e. current data technologies ,future data technologies and demographics of respondent.

IBM Cognos Dashboard Embedded (CDE) platform was used to analyze and visualize the results.

To Visualize the data ,dashboards were created to emphasis on the present and future trends of data technologies.

Data was visualized based on top 10 present and future data technology trends based on respondent gender ,formal education ,age and countries.

A modified subset of Stack Overflow data consisting of two data sets based on the demographics and data technologies were used to visualize the present and future data trends based on their demographics.

As these data sets were subsets of data sets and therefore they did not require a lot of cleaning . Hence no particular methodology was used to visualize the data. We only used filtering option to ignore the nulls values from data.

These are some of my Data analysis projects to demonstrate the skills which I learned in the past couple of months.

The first project Salary_Prediction & Analysis of Blatimore is a Analysis project on the Salary of Employees in Blatiore dataset where many insights where captured my EDA and Linear Regression was used to predict the salary of an employee.

The Second project is the IBM Data Analyst Capstone Project which is a part of IBM's Data Analyst specialization. The Skills leared in the Specialization Course was used on a Stackoverflow survey dataset which consists te current and future technologies used and to be used data collected from many students and developers. The project starts with collecting the data and ends with a presentation containing the summary of the insights found.

The Last project is a Analysis on the US Accident occured during the time period 2016 to 2020. The Dataset was obtained from Kaggel and EDA was performed to verify some hypothesis and get some insigts.

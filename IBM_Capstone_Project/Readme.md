## IBM Data Analyst Capstone Project
### About this Project

This Project is about appling various Data Analytics skills and techniques that I have learned as part of the IBM Data Analyst Professional Certification.

The tasks performed are collecting data from multiple sources, performing exploratory data analysis, data wrangling and preparation, statistical analysis and mining the data, creating charts and plots to visualize data, and building an interactive dashboard. The project also culminates with a presentation of my data analysis report, with an executive summary.

This project is a great opportunity to showcase my Data Analytics skills, and demonstrate my proficiency to potential employers.
